=== Multi-page schematics ===

Often I find myself drawing schematics which all logically belong at
the same level in a circuit, but will not sensibly fit on one printed
page.

I need to be able to draw the circuitry on multiple pages, and it would be
very helpful if the tools provided me a clear way of making electrical
connections between the pages.

It should be easy for me to navigate between the various pages of the design
(or design hierarchy block) I am working on, and ideally, when loading my
project (or schematic), I should be able to open all related pages at the
same time. I don't like having to explicitly find and open each page in
order to navigate to them.

As a pragmatic designer, I don't particularly care whether the multiple pages
of my schematic reside in the same file or not, just so long as they are easy
to work with.

In some of the other EDA tools I'm used to using, a project contains a list
of all the relevant source files without me opening each one individually.
This concept could perhaps be extended so the tool can let me navigate between
the various pages of my design.
