=== Multiple implementations ===

As someone who uses a schematic editor in multiple flows
(e.g. simulation, design entry), I would like the tool to be capable
of handling multiple implementations of each of my design units
(cells/entities). In addition to that, I would like to be able to switch
between such alternative implementation on cell by cell
or instance by instance basis.

Examples of situations where I may need such capability are:

. A schematic for simulation requires some additional instrumentation,
  which may not exist on the main "design entry" schematic.
. A design entry schematic may come in several slightly different versions
  for multiple products, which still fulfill the same contract
  (i.e. implement a single interface or have a common symbol).
. In addition to a schematic there might be an alternative netlist
  implementation. For example a source HDL file, or a spice netlist
  extracted from a layout.

As an implementor of a tool built on top of the design library, I would
like the library to be generic enough to store additional design data.

Such data can be:

. The design of a PCB.
. The layout of an IC design (full custom or digital flow back-end).
. Interface to simulation results 

Although the above may not necessarily be a goal for implementing the library,
any design tool relying on a 2D (or "2.5D"), cartesian grid representation
of data could use the library as a storage medium, contributing to the user
experience (e.g. cross-tool verification, fully functional copy-paste across
all the tools) and enabling reuse of a substantial chunk of the tool
implementation.
