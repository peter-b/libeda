=== Namespaces for Design Re-Use ===

As someone who regularly works on designs which need similar
functions, I want to be able to reuse circuits or groups of circuits
so I can quickly assemble new designs from tried and tested functional
blocks.

To make this task easy, I want these design parts to have as little
external dependencies or connections as possible, both intended and
(especially) unintended. Ideally, each functional should reside in its
own "namespace" and use only relative references (paths) in respect to it,
so that it can be easily relocated and reused in other designs.

This aspect is especially important for open hardware community as in this
scenario design reuse from multiple sources is particularly important.

I'd like to think of namespaces as of design libraries - having both these
mechanisms combined in one reduces the effort needed for using them. This
technique is used in some programming languages (Java, Python) and
HDLs (VHDL, SystemVerilog).
