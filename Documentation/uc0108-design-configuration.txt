=== Design Configuration Mechanism ===

As someone who uses a schematic editor in iterative design flows,
I would like to be able to reconfigure my design without a tedious
and error prone modifications of schematics at multiple levels of hierarchy.

Examples of situations where I may need such capability are:

. I simulate a circuit including a large array of identical blocks.
  To save the simulation time, I want to simulate only one or two
  of their instances at low level (e.g. a transistor level in the ASIC flow)
  and rest of them at a behavioral level (e.g. using an HDL description)
  to provide necessary functionality for the test to work.
. Switching between any multiple implementations of my design cell I may have.
  For example, after designing the layout I want to resimulate my circuit
  with netlists of some of the critical blocks extracted from their respective
  layout cells.
. I may want to change some parameters passed to some of the instances buried
  deep in the design hierarchy.
. I may want to change contents of some schematics buried deep in the design
  hierarchy (for example remove an instance or a wire connection).
