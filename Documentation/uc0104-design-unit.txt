=== Notion of a Design Unit ===

As someone who frequently exchanges parts of designs, I would like the tool to
have a notion of a "design unit" (an "entity", a "cell") which encompasses
both the interface (a symbol) and an implementation (schematic, netlist,
primitive model, etc.).

The tool should assist me in enforcing the integrity of the interface
and implementation by treating them as a single unit (conceptually,
not physically) and checking that there are no mismatches between the two.

Data that are subject to such checks are:

. A list of ports (including their ordering).
. Definitions of attributes.
. Other information not stored in a form of attributes (cell name?).
. Perhaps some cell level configuration.

// Local Variables:
// mode: adoc
// End:
